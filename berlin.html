        Welcome to Berlin! The vibrant, multicultural capital of Germany is rich with history and culture; there are countless museums, historical sites, and restaurants to visit. Since the World Cup will be occurring at the time of the wedding (and since Germany is the current reigning world champion), the city will be even more alive than ever. Below are a few recommendations from Taylor and Patrik based on their favorite things to do when they're in town.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 class="sub-header text-center" style="font-size: 2.5em;">East Side Gallery</h4>
      <p class="text-left">
        Located in the former East, this 1.3 km stretch of the Berlin Wall snaking along the Spree River is the longest continuous piece of the wall remaining in existence. It's covered in murals that you're bound to recognize from their ubiquity in modern culture. Start at the famous Oberbaumbrücke and work your way down!<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 class="sub-header text-center" style="font-size: 2.5em;">Museum Island</h4>
      <p class="text-left">
        Although it's home to five of Berlin's best museums, including the world-famous Pergamon, you don't need to be an art fan to enjoy the Museum Island. Taking a stroll through the Lustgarten in front of the stunning Berliner Dom is an absolute requirement when visiting Berlin!<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 class="sub-header text-center" style="font-size: 2.5em;">KaDeWe (Kaufhaus des Westens)</h4>
      <p class="text-left">
        As an avowed shopper, Taylor's favorite spot in Berlin is KaDeWe, "the Harrods of Germany." The main shopping center for the former West Berlin houses a staggering five floors of merchandise, a food hall, and is crowned with a beautiful food court on its top floor.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h4 class="sub-header text-center" style="font-size: 2.5em;">Fassbender und Rausch</h4>
      <p class="text-left">
        This luxurious chocolate shop is located on picturesque Gendarmenmarkt, home of the Berlin Konzerthaus. Every year while in Berlin for Christmas, Taylor and Patrik stop by Fassbender und Rausch to pick up gifts for their family and friends back in America. Enjoy the giant chocolate sculptures of famous landmarks displayed in the store on the first floor, and then venture upstairs to the Schokorestaurant to savor an Eisschockolade, a German specialty.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 class="sub-header text-center" style="font-size: 2.5em;">Cafe am Neuen See</h4>
      <p class="text-left">
        One of Patrik's favorite restaurants in Berlin is this beer garden situated near the Berliner Zoo in the beautiful Tiergarten park. If you're interested in attending a World Cup public viewing (especially if Germany is playing), this is the place to be.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h4 class="sub-header text-center" style="font-size: 2.5em;">Brandenburg Gate/Unter den Linden</h4>
      <p class="text-left">
        The most obvious suggestion of all is still worth a visit. Walk from the Reichstag through the Brandenburg Gate (making sure to stop at the nearby Holocaust memorial, a very moving piece of public art) and down the scenic Unter den Linden street to get the total historical Berlin experience. Walk until you hit Friedrichstraße, arguably the biggest shopping street in the city, and check out the little inside joke on the corner buildings: the area is known as Upper East Side Berlin, which always tickles Taylor, a former UES (New York) resident.
