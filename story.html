	    	<p>Taylor and Patrik met the day after Valentine’s Day in 2013. After hosting a poker night for his engineering fraternity, Theta Tau, Patrik was invited to tag along to a party at the off-campus apartment of Taylor’s friends. When he arrived, he was introduced as “Patrik the German,” which immediately caught Taylor’s interest. After the customary games of Kings had died down and the party had grown bigger and more fractured, Taylor noticed Patrik sitting by himself on the couch and decided to strike up a conversation.
			  It wasn’t long before they were falling for each other – hard enough to commit to a long-distance relationship a mere two months after they started dating.</p>

	    	<p>When they met, Taylor and Patrik were both students at the University of Pennsylvania, but Taylor was a senior, and Patrik a sophomore. (This is thanks to some quirks of the German system: an extra year of secondary school and a gap year necessitated by mandatory civil service. Patrik is actually six months older than Taylor.) When Taylor graduated, she moved to New York. This didn’t deter Patrik. Over the next two and a half years, both of them became very familiar with Bolt Bus, 30th Street Station, and the long, long hike from Penn Station to 12th Avenue. During this time, Patrik completed both his undergraduate degree and his first Master’s while Taylor worked in New York.</p>

	    	<p>In January 2016, Patrik moved to New York to pursue his second Master’s degree at Columbia University, where Taylor now worked and studied. They lived with Mallomar and Popcorn, the guinea pigs they had adopted the year before, in a tiny room on the sixth floor of an apartment near Columbia. After Patrik's first semester ended, they moved to their own apartment in Inwood, the most northern neighborhood in Manhattan. In May 2017, Patrik graduated from the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.</p>

	    	<p>In their four years together, Taylor and Patrik have had many adventures. They spent countless hours riding buses and trains back and forth from New York to Philadelphia to New Jersey, where they spent time with Taylor's parents. And every winter, they fly to Europe, where they spend Christmas in Davos, Switzerland and New Year's in Berlin, Germany with Patrik's family. They've also explored Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Munich, and Dresden together.</p>

	    	<p>On June 3, 2017, Patrik led Taylor to the southern tip of Manhattan, where the sailboat Tara waited. He'd brought her favorite wine and a picnic lunch. The day was perfect: a stunning 75 degrees, blue skies, fluffy clouds. It was ideal for setting sail with a view of the Manhattan skyline. In the Hudson River, bobbing in front of the Statue of Liberty, Patrik proposed. Naturally, the only answer was "Of course!" They know that marriage is the next big adventure and can’t wait to see where the future takes them.</p>
